## Trusted Advisor Tools

### Overview
Trusted Advisor provides real time guidance to help users provision their resources following AWS best practices. You can now create configurable, rule-based events for automated actions based on AWS Trusted Advisorâ€™s library of best-practice checks using Amazon CloudWatch Events.
The sample functions provided help to automate Trusted Advisor best practices using Amazon Cloudwatch events and AWS Lambda. 

### Setup and Usage
For example, you can automatically stop EC2 instances that have low utilization recommended by Trusted Advisor using Amazon Cloudwatch events and AWS Lambda to reduce cost using the following instructions:

1. Create an Amazon IAM role for the Lambda function to use. Attach the [IAM policy](LowUtilizationEC2Instances/IAMPolicy) to the role in the IAM console.
Documentation on how to create an IAM policy is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html
Documentation on how to create an IAM role for Lambda is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-console

2. Create a Lambda javascript function using the [sample](LowUtilizationEC2Instances/LambdaFunction.js) provided and choose the IAM role created in step 1. Make sure to set the appropriate tags and region per your requirements in configuration section of the Lambda function. 
More information about Lambda is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/getting-started.html

3. Create a Cloudwatch event rule to trigger the Lambda function created in step 2 matching the WARN status and the Low Utilization EC2 Instances Trusted Advisor check. An example of this is highlighted in the sample [Cloudwatch Event Pattern](LowUtilizationEC2Instances/CloudwatchEventPattern).
Documentation on to create a Trusted Advisor Cloudwatch events rule is available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/cloudwatch-events-ta.html

Please note that this is a just an example of how to setup automation with Trusted Advisor, Cloudwatch and Lambda. We recommend testing it and tailoring to your envirnment before using in your production envirnment.
